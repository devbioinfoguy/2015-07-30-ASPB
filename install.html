  <strong>Requirements:</strong>
Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to bring in and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.  (We will provide instructions on setting up the required software several days in advance)
<em> There are no pre-requisites, and we will assume no prior knowledge about the tools.</em>
